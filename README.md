## Overview
Tutor Finder is a web app that connects tutors and students the way ride-sharing services connect drivers and riders. It's based on a  model that's proven successful for businesses like [Care.com](http://www.care.com) and many others.

Version 1.0 includes the app's basic functionality: account creation and registration, and appointment creation. Users can register as tutor or student. Tutors can select one of three subjects, English, math, or web development, and students can make appointments by selecting a subject and viewing the available tutors. 

## Technical Specifications
We built Tutor Finder with the following technologies: 
* Node.js,
* Express,
* MySQL,
* Sequelize,
* Handlebars,
* Passport.js,
* and Materialize, Anime, and Vegas.

## Future Improvements
We'd like to continue developing this project to add:
* geolocation,
* customizable profiles,
* tutor reviews, 
* chat,
* and notifications.
